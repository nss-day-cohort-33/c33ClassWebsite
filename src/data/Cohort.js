I decided to make the switch to software engineering because I love the process of creating things based off of ideas and appreciate the logic behind coding. I've really enjoyed the challenge of constantly learning in such a dynamic field and contributing in a group setting to solve a common problem."

Two skills that come in handy in this industry, and which really became a big draw for me to get into this field. Nothing is more satisfying to me than getting a delete button to delete what you want, instead of, you know, wiping your whole database. My original background was graphic design, but after freelancing, I found out I'd rather be the one creating the interface than designing it, and I couldn't be happier with my choice! "
