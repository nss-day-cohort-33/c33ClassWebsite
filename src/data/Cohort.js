        "bio": `Before beginning my career in software development, I had a career in the commercial construction industry. I worked as a superintendent, supervising and managing multiple projects at a time around Nashville. After about a decade in the construction industry, I decided to make a change. I decided to enter the technology industry as a developer; something I had been contemplating for several years. This was one of the hardest decisions I have ever made, and I would not take it back for
        anything!`
