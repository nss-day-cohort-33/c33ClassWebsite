                    Steve Brownlee and Joe Shepherd: Thank you for giving us the opportunity to experience learning from two great instructors. Two styles of teaching
                    and problem solving provided us the opportunity to grow in our own unique ways. You taught us to recognize strength in vulnerability and how
                    vulnerability fostered growth. Thank you for trusting us to build a full stack application and praising us for exceeding your expectations. This has been
                    an awesome journey and we could not have asked for better guides. We appreciate the dad jokes, 80's music selections, and theatrical performances that
                    added some much needed humor to the process! <br /><br />

                    To Madi Peper, Kristin Norris, Mo Silva, and Leah Hoefling: Thank you for supporting us through the Peaks and Valleys of becoming software developers. Being recent graduates,
                    your knowledge, support and understanding was invaluable. You encouraged us and let us the know the impossible was possible. You pushed us and at times carried us through the
                    tears, frustrations and fear. You also celebrated our successes, capstone completions, "Aha" moments, and when the "light bulb" finally came on. Thank you for continuing to
                    check on us and support us as you moved on to other cohorts. You have all touched us in one way or the other. Continue to be the "Superstars" you are!! <br /><br />

                    To Ashley Canino and Kristin McKinney: Thank you for all your hard work to prepare us to enter the workforce. We know it is challenging to get us to focus on career development
                    tools in the middle of sprints. We appreciate the efforts in connecting us with employers, scheduling roundtable events and mock interviews. Thank you for the scheduled talks
                    throughout our time at NSS that guided us through the interviewing process. Your support is never ending and we appreciate all that you do!<br></br>

                    <div style={{ fontWeight: "bold", textAlign: "center", color: "white" }}>To the BEST Cohort EVER-C33...</div><br />

                    From day one Joe recognized we were a "special" bunch, a class dominated by PC's that would haunt us with every install. We also were the most extroverted group so we
                    were willing to help each other before asking for help from the team. Thanks to the "Seat Squirrel(Sydney)" that made sure we did not get comfortable and had to meet someone
                    new daily. We found reasons to celebrate with cake, cookies, candy, and donuts. We supported each other during class and on weekends by meeting in our homes and coffee shops to code.
                    Wherever the journey takes us, continue to be open to learning and supporting growth in others!!  <br /><br />

                    <div style={{ fontWeight: "bold", textAlign: "center", color: "white" }}>And Finally to John Wark...</div><br />

                    Thank you for creating a space for nontraditional software developers. Without your tireless efforts of connecting with the Nashville community to give us a chance, there would not be a
                    Nashville Software School. For that reason, we are grateful. We are grateful for your experiences and your talks to help us succeed as software developers. As we go our separate ways, we will
                    support NSS through encouraging others to attend and being an example to our employers of the skill level that is produced. Thank You!!
