Two skills that come in handy in this industry, and which really became a big draw for me to get into this field. Nothing is more satisfying to me than getting a delete button to delete what you want, instead of, you know, wiping your whole database. My original background was graphic design, but after freelancing, I found out I'd rather be the one creating the interface than designing it, and I couldn't be happier with my choice! "

In a previous life I worked in Television for shows such as Fixer Upper, America's Got Talent, and various crime shows but after 5 years of keeping track of fake severed heads and using the word 'shiplapped' more times than I can count I felt I was being called for something else. For a year I worked as an event manager for the Tennessee Performing Arts Center where I stumbled upon an online class on computer science while on a lunch break. It was love at first sight! I found myself playing around with code more and more during my downtime. When I learned about about NSS I decided to make it official and begin making my passion into my career. I can't wait to see where this new path takes me."

        "bio": "Before becoming a software programmer, I was working in sales for a luxury tour operator out of Chicago. My curiosity for software development was sparked by conversations with family and friends in the industry. During my time in Chicago, I often strategized best system practices for my department. I began to help new employees navigate our system effectively. With more understanding of our internal software, I found myself passing along ideas to company leaders to make the user experience easier. I began to see a parallel between making a better user experience in my workplace and the work that developers were doing on a day-to-day basis. From there, the idea of being a part of the industry consumed me, and after some time I had no choice but to embark on this new journey. Software programming enables me to look at problems from a different perspective every day. I enjoy the planning process and seeing a solution to a challenge come to life. As a lifelong learner, software development promises a future that will be incredibly fulfilling."

My two best friends, both software developers, encouraged me to try out software development. Shortly after I left my job as a nurse, I started to buckle down and teach myself Java, and fell in love. I decided to formalize my education and officially make my career transition after enrolling at Nashville Software School. I am excited to see where my new career path takes me!"

Being a long-time private guitar teacher myself, I am sensitive to the deeper understanding required of something in order to each it, and I became excited at the realization that a career in programming would, by necessity, draw me into a deeper understanding of reality.  I consider myself a life-long student, and enjoy the nuances and complexities of software development."
