Throughout the years, my involvement with technology waned as I entered the workforce and took on more responsibilities as my job progressed, but my fascination for the internet and programming never left. When my former company decided to implement a new WMS system I was once again in the middle of a world of incredibly useful, interesting, and mysterious technology. It was from that experience that I really started to ask myself if this was something that I could dive myself into and find a sense of fulfillment. As you can see I clearly came to the answer that, yes, it was. I am ready to continue this journey of learning, challenges, and creating things that help people with their lives and businesses. `\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": 25,\n        \"firstName\": \"Curt\",\n        \"lastName\": \"Cato\",\n        \"portfolio\": \"https://curtcato.github.io/\",\n        \"linkedin\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/curtcato/\",\n        \"github\": \"https://github.com/CurtCato\",\n        \"email\": \"ccato829@gmail.com\",\n        \"reelThemIn\": `“Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do.” -Mark Twain`,\n        \"bio\": `Before beginning my career in software development, I had a career in the commercial construction industry.

We appreciate the efforts in connecting us with employers, scheduling roundtable events and mock interviews.
